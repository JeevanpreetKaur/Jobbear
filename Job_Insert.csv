What Does a Data Analyst Do?
A data analyst is a person whose job is to gather and interpret data in order to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of time spent with data but entails communicating findings too.
Hereâ€™s what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:

- Gather data: Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying datasets from data collection specialists.
- Clean data: Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the quality of data in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations wonâ€™t be wrong or skewed.
- Model data: This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what types of data to store and collect, establish how data categories are related to each other, and work through how the data actually appears.
- Interpret data: Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that could answer the question at hand.
- Present: Communicating the results of your findings will be a key part of your job. You do this by putting together visualizations like charts and graphs, writing reports, and presenting information to interested parties.
â€¢ *APPLY NOW TO LEARN MORE!***

These are mainly websites that already have AA code via LAUNCH but are adding new a product page or features and need additional tracking. So you would do a quick audit, review the existing JS call, variable map and see what needs to be done to... code new Sprops or Evars.

After a brief meeting with the client, you would scope the job for me and help deliver new code/tracking in a timely manner. You would also be given access to sandbox or testing site for verification and pull a simple report for managers.

If you are interested please email me a brief resume and put ADOBE LAUNCH in the subject line and i will connect over zoom or phone.

356,356,Data Scientist,Mynd, Anywhere ,via LinkedIn,"About Mynd:

Mynd is a tech-enabled real estate company serving the $85B+ property management and real estate investment market. In the past few years, consumers have gained access to free stock trades, greater transparency in the mortgage market, and apps that make managing their money more convenient. Yet real estate investment, the most powerful tool for building generational wealth, has... largely been the purview of wealthier individuals and professional money managers.

Mynd is determined to overhaul that paradigm.

At Mynd, weâ€™re on a mission to democratize access to happy homes and sustainable investments by making the purchase of single-family residential real estate as effortless as other types of investments. Investing in real estate can be intimidating, especially for first-time buyers. Moreover, many potential investors donâ€™t want to buy real estate in their geographic area, or have been priced out of competitive big city housing markets.

With operations in 25 markets across the U.S. and real-time insights via our platform, we remove the time, communication, and geographic barriers traditionally associated with buying real estate. Investors can now find, purchase, lease, manage, and sell single-family rental properties 100 percent remotely.

Mynd is Best Places to Work certified, a Built In SF Best Places to Work 2022 winner, and was named the #1 fastest-growing East Bay company by the San Francisco Business Times in 2021. Weâ€™ve attracted talent from Starwood Waypoint Homes, The New York Times, McKinsey, BCG, Compass, Better, One Medical, Zillow, Upwork, WeWork, and Facebook. Weâ€™re backed by top VCs, including Lightspeed, Canaan, Jackson Square, and QED, and recently announced a $5 billion deal with Invesco Real Estate that will make us the largest buyer of single-family rental homes in the country.

380,380,Excel calculation for interest on invoices,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"I have a table of interests that should apply during certain periods.

see the excel ""interests""

the row

2015/21/07/2015 31/12/2015 8,5

means that in the second half of 2015 the applied interest is 8,5

then I have an excel with invoices. They have a number, a date and an amount.

Interest should be calculated ONE MONTH after the issue date.

interests are calculated pro rata by the number of days in the period over 365/364 (taking into account leap year)

they must be added up to the total amount and also a description should be made in this format :

period @amount = xâ‚¬ + period @amount = xâ‚¬ + ....

there is a website in dutch that make the calculation but for one invoice only : https://www.krisslabbaert.be/intrestberekening - it has one small error it changes the interest per 1/6 instead of per 1/7 (the interest changes every half year)

I also make a loom video to explain more

At PicnicHealth, we are building deep real-world datasets fueling cutting-edge research while giving patients control of their own medical record data. These complete, clinically-rich datasets produce unique insights â€” across dozens of diseases â€” to ultimately get the right treatments into patientsâ€™ hands faster. We do this by working directly with patients and... leveraging state of the art machine learning to transform messy medical records into structured, research-ready datasets. To date weâ€™ve helped tens of thousands of patients securely access their records and proactively contribute to advancing research in diseases that impacts their lives.

We raised $60 million in funding in a Series C in April 2022 led by B Capital Group. Our existing investors Felicis Ventures and Amplify Partners also joined the round, bringing the total we have raised to more than $100 million.

And we are just getting started! If you are looking to join an award winning, mission-driven, motivated team that is making a real impact across millions of peopleâ€™s lives, PicnicHealth might just be the place for you.

The Opportunity

Our data has a wide range of use cases across therapeutic areas and development stages, and youâ€™ll drive success by articulating the vision, building the roadmap, and enabling our life sciences partners.

Youâ€™ll be focused on the data itself as a product, focused on customer use and journey with our datasets. Youâ€™ll partner with the team members that work most closely with our datasets and our customers â€” the commercial team, epidemiologists, quantitative scientists, and clinicians. Youâ€™ll collaborate with product managers to make the underlying platform changes needed to produce better datasets, the PMs responsible for data production and patient application experiences. Youâ€™ll make and own the roadmap for our data product, and drive cross functionally

There is massive potential in deep, patient-centric medical data to accelerate improvements in patient treatment. These datasets have the power to make it easier and faster to get better treatments into patients hands. If you take this on, your job will be unlocking that potential, having a transformational impact on PicnicHealth, on our partners, and on patientsâ€™ lives.

As the Product Lead, you will:

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We're the Internet's optimists. Our technology makes sure the data travelling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it's not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other's backs, we recognise our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another - from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we're committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

Through a deep understanding of and commitment to communities that are the least likely to cause global climate change yet face the highest impacts, ISC develops creative and inclusive solutions, demonstrated in our work in the US and across Asia in China, India, the Mekong, and Bangladesh. We actively partner with frontline organizations, subnational governments, and the private sector to co-create programs that support underinvested communities, women, and people experiencing poverty who comprise the global majority. ISC remains cognizant of communities' varying needs, and we tailor our approach to support those needs. We believe equity and inclusion are fundamental to building healthy, prosperous, and peaceful communities and are committed to furthering equitable climate action.

Want to create customer value with digital and turn your ideas into human impact? So do we...

Thereâ€™s one in every groupâ€”the person who dreams big and has the motivation to bring their ideas to life, even as others might roll their eyes and prefer to play it safe. Are you that person?

We relentlessly challenge, inspire, and support our client partners and each other.

Want the agility and energy of a start-up, backed by the resources of Accenture, Microsoft and the Center for Information Systems Research at MIT Sloan School of Management?

848,848,I Need Help With My Dying YouTube Channel,Upwork, Anywhere ,via Upwork,"Please read this full description prior to responding. I am a YouTuber who has had successful videos in the past and now my channelâ€™s momentum has completely died off. I get barely any viewâ€™s anymore. I need an expert with a proven track record to help me clearly define who my core audience is or could be and assist me in planning topics to make videos about based on what they would want to see. I want to figure out what topics that are in my wheelhouse provide the most value to my viewers. I get lots of views on my YouTube shorts and on tiktok with my rant videos but my long form videos on YouTube have fallen completely flat. Iâ€™m looking for someone who is RESULTS DRIVEN and has gotten results for other content creators in the past with a proven and verifiable track record! Every successful YouTuber that I see seems to have some sort of formula for success and I have no idea where they all have learned it from because I have paid multiple people for courses that have had very little... effect on my success outside of what I figured out on my own just by creating a bunch of videos. So I repeat Iâ€™m looking to work with someone who has experience and a track record of success growing YouTube channels. Please do not contact me unless you are confident in your ability to create an effective channel growth strategy based on analytics, data, and trends. A proven strategy that can be implemented consistently.

About Vanna Health

Vanna is reimagining healthcare for people living with serious mental illness (SMI).

Today, our healthcare system is failing people with SMI.

They also face a higher risk of disfranchisement from society, including homelessness (6x), unemployment (30x), and incarceration (25x).

Our mission is to empower people with SMI to thrive by finding purpose and a sense of belonging in the community. The solution is social, not just medical. Vanna provides psychosocial rehabilitation and enables community-based care at scale, in close collaboration with existing healthcare and community organizations. Our model is designed to restore hope and nurture engagement by investing in a foundation of mutual trust and respect.

Vanna brings together an unprecedented team of proven entrepreneurs, individuals with lived experience, and national leaders in behavioral health. We are committed to providing individuals with culturally inclusive support for all races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other social factors.

About Vanna Health

Vanna is reimagining healthcare for people living with serious mental illness (SMI).

Today, our healthcare system is failing people with SMI. Despite $200B in annual medical spending, people with SMI die 20 years younger than their peers while suffering from higher rates of preventable disease (2x). They also face a higher risk of disfranchisement from society, including homelessness (6x), unemployment (30x), and incarceration (25x).

Our mission is to empower people with SMI to thrive by finding purpose and a sense of belonging in the community. The solution is social, not just medical. Vanna provides psychosocial rehabilitation and enables community-based care at scale, in close collaboration with existing healthcare and community organizations. Our model is designed to restore hope and nurture engagement by investing in a foundation of mutual trust and respect.

Vanna brings together an unprecedented team of proven entrepreneurs, individuals with lived experience, and national leaders in behavioral health. We are committed to providing individuals with culturally inclusive support for all races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other social factors.

898,898,Senior Data Analyst,Loop, Anywhere ,via LinkedIn,"Loop is in an unparalleled position to provide data to our merchants that no one else can replicate. Data will be at the core of everything we do and some of our most critical work as we grow. Our future is to create data-based products that use modern techniques to deliver data and invaluable insights. We're establishing the conditions to allow anyone to answer most of their business questions... independently, and you'll contribute to the frameworks and culture that reward the effective utilization of data across the organization.

â€¢ Building enterprise-wide data models for on-demand, tactical, strategic, and self-service data analysis.

As a Senior Data Analyst at Loop, you'll impact our ability to solve merchant problems and fulfill merchant needs. Your work analyzing and synthesizing large-scale data and outputs will guide business decisions made by stakeholders at all levels. You will be successful in this role if you're self-motivated and can run projects independently while collaborating with team members and business stakeholders.

Weâ€™ve laid out the experience we think is important to set you up for success in this role.
